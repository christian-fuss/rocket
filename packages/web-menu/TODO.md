MUST HAVE:

- next/previous presets
- get rid of the css class attribute in the nav `<nav aria-label="Breadcrumb" class="web-menu-breadcrumb">`

NICE TO HAVE:

- Use [Colorette](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colorette) instead of chalk
- Fork tree-model and "modernice it" es6, esm, types
- Evaluate [Commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) instead of command-line-args
- Blog needs support for tags & hero image
